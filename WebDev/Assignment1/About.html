<h1>A brief history of the Bass Guitar </h1>
<h3>Let's have a quick history lesson...</h3>

<!Page Content>
<p class="MainPageContent">The <em>Bass</em> guitar one of the foundational instruments when it comes to music. It is responsible for holding down the rhythm along with the drums.</p>
<p class="MainPageContent">Emerging in the 1930's, it was the answer to the problem of the need for a louder and more prominent low-end sound in big Jazz ensembles. The Bass continued to evolve throughout the decades into the instrument we know now. </p>
<br>
<p class="MainPageContent">The Standard Bass has 4 strings and is usually 76CM in length. This affords the instrument a wide range of notes...</p>

<p class="MainPageContent">
    The four-string Bass guitar is traditionally tuned to E, A, D, and G, while extended-range basses, such as five-string or six-string models, can reach lower frequencies or extend into higher registers.
    Ultimately, the range of a bass guitar can vary depending on factors such as the number of strings, scale length, and the specific design of the instrument.
